Hello! Welcome to my first "project".
This code took about 3 hours and I tried my best to add detailed comments.
To run the code you simply run it along with the provided NMAP scan, but I'm sure it would work for most other NMAP scans.
If you have any ideas on how I could expand and improve it, please let me know!
